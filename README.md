Towards a Resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis: Integrating Quantum Physics, Field Theory, and Advanced Analytical Methods
Fred David Blum
Abstract
The Riemann Hypothesis, proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, remains one of the most significant unsolved problems in mathematics. This paper explores a novel interdisciplinary approach to investigating the Riemann Hypothesis by integrating ideas from quantum physics, field theory, and advanced analytical methods. We establish a correspondence between the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the energy levels of specific quantum systems. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory, quantum chaos, and spectral analysis, we aim to provide new insights into the distribution of the zeros on the critical line. Additionally, we present improved computational methods and Python code to visualize and analyze the concepts discussed.
